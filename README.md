This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug associated with using std::vector<bool> in C++.  The issue stems from the fact that std::vector<bool> is specially optimized for memory usage, which leads to non-standard iterator behavior and can result in unexpected data corruption or incorrect results when used with algorithms or functions that assume typical random-access iterator semantics. The example provided highlights this behavior and demonstrates a solution using std::vector<char> or std::vector<uint8_t> as a more predictable alternative.
